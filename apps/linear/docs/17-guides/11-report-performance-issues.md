# Report performance issues

Linear is engineered to be a highly performant application. If you're experiencing performance issues with the app, we’d like know about it. Follow the steps outlined below so we can investigate and resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

## What to include in your performance report

To help us diagnose and fix performance issues effectively, please include the following information in your report:

* **Short written description:** Briefly describe the performance problem you're experiencing (e.g., "The app becomes unresponsive when loading the projects list").
* **Screen recording:** A video recording showing the issue in action helps us see exactly what you're experiencing. You can use the built in screen recording tool on [MacOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/take-a-screenshot-mh26782/mac) or [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots-00246869-1843-655f-f220-97299b865f6b) or a 3rd party tool like [Loom](https://www.loom.com/).
* **Performance snapshot:** A Chrome performance profile captured while the issue occurs provides technical data we can analyze.
* **Confirm workspace data access:** Please confirm in writing if you consent to our team accessing obfuscated data from your workspace to help diagnose the issue. All sensitive data is anonymized, so we will never be able to see issue details etc.
