## Background

If there are collaborators who are submitting log entries for approval, a user with 'Admin' permissions will need to approve the entries. In addition, if pending entries have been created through the Missing Companies feature, they will need to be approved by a user with 'Standard' or 'Admin' permissions. Admins can also choose to reject an entry so that the collaborator must resubmit a new entry.   
See [Approve or Reject Daily Log Entries](/product-manuals/daily-log-project/tutorials/approve-or-reject-daily-log-entries).

This article will discuss different methods for finding and viewing pending Daily Log entries.

## Steps

There are multiple ways to view pending entries within the Daily Log. Listed below are methods Procore recommends for finding and viewing pending entries.

### Viewing a day or date range where pending entries are present

When viewing a specific day or date range in the Daily Log list view, a banner will appear at the top of the page if any pending entries exist within those days.

### View the Daily Log calendar view

The calendar view is used for viewing a large amount of days at a time. If any pending entries exist within a day, a message will be on that day along with the number of pending entries. Clicking that day will open a side panel where the pending entries can be reviewed and approved or rejected.

### Create a custom report

A user with the correct permissions can create a custom report within the Reports tool to view pending Daily Log entries.   
See [Create a Custom Project Report](/product-manuals/reports-project/tutorials/create-a-project-single-tool-report) for more information on report creation, including permissions.
