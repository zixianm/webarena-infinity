# Sections and blocks

You can use sections in your theme to create the layout that you want for your online store. Sections are made up of different types of blocks that each have a specific function, such as text, buttons, single images, a collage of images, or links.

Sections and blocks provide flexibility in how you arrange your content, and allow you to control the style and feel of your online store without the need to edit code, including the following customization options:

* You can rearrange sections in your templates, and rearrange blocks within sections.
* Sections and blocks can have specific customization settings.
* You can connect compatible sections and blocks to display dynamic information on your online store from custom data, such as adding [care instructions for your products](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metafields/using-metafields). Learn more about connecting [dynamic sources](sections-and-blocks.md#dynamic-source-selector).

The sections and blocks that are available in the theme editor depend on your theme and theme version. For example, your theme might have a **Slide** block that you can add only to a **Slideshow** section, and a **Heading** text block that you can add to all of your theme's sections. For more information about which options are available to you, refer to your theme's documentation.

### Section and block maximum limits

Sections and blocks have the following maximum limitations:

* Each [template](templates.md) can have up to 25 sections.
* Each template can have up to 1250 blocks across all sections. The exact number of blocks, and the number of each type of block that you can add to each section depend on the section and block sources, and are specified by the theme designer for your theme. For example, if your theme has an **Email signup** section, then you might only be able to add one **Email form** block.
* Blocks that support nesting can have up to eight levels of nested blocks.

## Block sources

Depending on your theme's structure, and the apps that you have installed, your theme might contain a variety of sections that accept blocks from different sources. When you add a block to a section, all available blocks for that section display in the block picker. Depending on your theme and theme version, you can add the following types of blocks to sections in your theme:

* [**App blocks**](../customizing-themes/apps.md#app-blocks) are blocks that adds functionality to your theme. You can use an app block to reposition areas of your theme added by your installed apps to a specific area of a page in your theme.
* [**Section blocks**](sections-and-blocks.md#theme-blocks) are blocks that are defined within a specific section.
* [**Theme blocks**](sections-and-blocks.md#theme-blocks) are blocks that are defined within your theme and can have dynamic functionality, such as nesting.

Your theme can contain some sections that use [section blocks](sections-and-blocks.md#section-blocks) and other sections that use [theme blocks](sections-and-blocks.md#theme-blocks). A single section can accept either theme blocks or section blocks, but not a mixture both.

The availability of app blocks within sections depend on the app's functionality, and whether the section can accept app blocks.

### Section blocks

Section blocks are blocks that are designed for a specific section. A section can have limits for the types of section blocks, and limit the number of a certain type of block that you can add.

### Example of a section with section blocks

For example, your theme has an **Email signup** section. You can use this section to add a newsletter signup form so that customers can subscribe to your newsletter. After you add the **Email signup** section, you can add one of each of the following blocks:

* an **Email form** block
* a **Heading** block
* a **Subheading** block

If you add the **Email form** block and click  **Add block** to add another block, then the **Email form** block no longer displays as an option in the block picker. This limitation helps prevent any issues with capturing the customer's email, and ensures that the customer can easily enter their email address.

If you've added all three of the available blocks for the **Email signup** section, then the block picker displays a message that all available blocks have been used.

### Theme blocks

Theme blocks are blocks that are defined within your theme and can have dynamic functionality, such as nesting. Sections that accept theme blocks can accept a variety of different blocks, depending on the section's structure. A section that accepts theme blocks might accept all available theme blocks, a specific subset of blocks, or blocks unique to that section. Theme blocks might also have the following behaviors:

* Some blocks support nesting, so that you can nest blocks within other blocks up to eight levels.
* Some sections have required blocks. You can customize or hide these blocks, but you can't re-order or delete them.
* Some blocks display automatically in a section when certain conditions are met.

### Example of a section with theme blocks

For example, your theme has a **Slideshow** section with theme blocks.

In the slideshow section of your theme, when you click  **Add block**, you can select a **Slide** block from the block picker. No other block types are available. If you try to add a **Slide** block to another section in your theme, such as an **Image banner** section, then **Slide** isn't available. This is an example of a restricted block.

After you add a **Slide** block to the **Slideshow** section, you can click  **Add block** to add additional blocks to any **Slide** blocks in the **Slideshow** section, such as a **Heading**, **Image**, **Button**. These blocks are nested in the **Slide** block. This is an example of a nested block.

If you add a second **Slide** block to the **Slideshow** section, then the theme automatically adds a **Slideshow controls** block. This block displays buttons that visitors to your site can click to navigate from one slide to the another. You can customize the style of buttons or hide the controls, but you can't remove or delete the block. This is an example of a required block that displays conditionally.

### Theme block compatibility

To access theme blocks, your theme must have sections that support theme blocks. You can check whether your theme supports theme blocks in your theme's code. If there's a **blocks** directory in the sidebar of the liquid editor, then you're using a theme that supports theme blocks. You can also check your theme's documentation.

#### Steps:

1. From your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store** > [**Themes**](https://admin.shopify.com/themes).
2. Next to the theme that you want to check, click the  button, and then click **Edit Code**.
3. In the sidebar, search for the blocks folder.

## Customizing your theme templates with sections and blocks

You can use the drop-down menu to select a different template, such as products, collections, pages, or blogs, or use the search bar in the template drop-down to search for a specific template. When you select a template, it loads into the theme editor, and any changes you make are previewed in the editor.

## Renaming a section or block

By default, a section or block's title in the theme editor sidebar menu and settings details is set to the block or section type, such as "Collection" or "Text".

For blocks, if the block settings contains a text field, such as a heading or description, then that text is also appended to the title in the sidebar menu. If there is more than one text field, then the first text field that has content is appended. When you change the text in the text field, then the block title changes to include the updated text. A section or block name can't be blank.

For example, you add a **Multicolumn** section to your page template with **Column** blocks. The column block includes has a **Heading** setting with the default text `Column`, and a **Description** setting with the default text `Pair text with an image to focus on your chosen product, collection, or blog post.` both. The default section title is `Multicolumn`. The default **Column** block title is `Column - Column`. If you remove the text from the **Heading** section, then block title updates to `Column - Pair text with an imag...`

You can rename any section or block to a custom name from the section or block's settings in the theme editor sidebar menu.

## Working with blocks

Blocks are customizable modules that you use to add content to the sections in your templates. You can use blocks to add text, images, links, buttons, and more.

Shopify themes have sections and blocks that you can customize. Some sections have fixed block types, which means that you can choose only from the blocks that are made available to that section by the theme designer.

Other sections allow you to select any block, but there's a limit on the total number of blocks that you can add to the section. If your section reaches the maximum number of blocks available, then the **Add block** option is greyed out and you can't click or tap it.

You can use the search to find a specific block by name, or select a block from the block picker drop-down menu. Your theme's blocks might be sorted into categories in the block picker, such as **Collection** for blocks with a collection picker, or **Media** for image and video blocks.

A preview of the block displays in the block picker so that you can review the block's display before you add it.

## Use metafields and metaobjects with dynamic sources

You can use [metafields](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metafields) and [metaobjects](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metaobjects) to display dynamic information on your online store. If you have a theme that supports metafields, then you can connect a metafield to a compatible section or block settings in the theme editor.

For example, if you sell candles, then you might want to display burn times for each candle available on your store. After you set up a product metafield for `Burn time` in the **Custom data** section of your Shopify admin settings, you can add a text block to your product template's main section. In the text block, you can click the  button on the text setting and select the **Burn time** metafield. Burn time information will now display on your products.

If you have a Shopify theme, then you can connect most metafields and metaobjects to your theme by using the theme editor. If you're using other themes, or if you want to add custom data types that your theme doesn't support, then you can [edit your theme code](../customizing-themes/edit-code/edit-theme-code.md#edit-your-theme-code) or hire a Shopify Partner to help you.
Learn more about [hiring a Shopify Partner](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/partner-directory).

Not all sections or blocks support dynamic sources. Check your [theme's architecture version](../managing-themes/versions.md) and available customization options in [the theme editor](../customizing-themes/theme-editor/features-overview.md) to determine whether your theme supports dynamic sources.

You can display dynamic information in your online store by adding sections or blocks that can use dynamic sources. Dynamic sources can be used in any template, section, or block that displays compatible resources (product, collection, page, blog and blog post). You need to [add your metafield](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metafields) before you can connect it in your templates. Refer to [*Dynamic sources*](https://shopify.dev/themes/architecture/settings#dynamic-sources) for more information about using metafields and metaobjects with dynamic sources in your theme.

After you complete the setup process, follow the steps below to connect dynamic sources to sections or blocks in your theme, using the  button.

### Dynamic source selector

You can use the dynamic source selector to connect the correct dynamic source directly in the theme editor. Review the following key features of the dynamic source selector:

* You can reference dynamic sources from various resources, where applicable. For instance, if you connect a setting to a block that is connected to both a product resource and a page resource, then you can use the drop-down menu in the dynamic source selector to specify whether you want to search for metafields associated with either the product or the page resource.
* The dynamic source selector has a search and filter functionality to help you find the metafield that you need.
* The dynamic source selector lets you choose [category metafields](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metafields/category-metafields). These are additional attributes that become available when you assign a [product category](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/details/product-category) to a product. Accessing these metafields allows you to connect dynamic sources to any relevant fields on the underlying attribute metaobject.
