# Editing theme code

You can edit your theme code to make detailed changes to your online store with the code editor. Most of the files that make up a theme contain [Liquid](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid), Shopify's templating language. Theme files also contain HTML, CSS, JSON, and JavaScript. Edit the code for a theme only if you know HTML and CSS, and have a basic understanding of Liquid.

You can edit your theme's code only after you've purchased it. This includes using the AI code generator in the theme editor. If you're using a trial version of a paid theme, then you need to purchase it before you can make code changes.

The code editor displays a directory of your theme's files, and a space to display and edit the files. When you click a file in the directory, it opens in the code editor. You can open and edit multiple files at the same time. You can also open and review multiple files at the same time.

## Theme Check

The code editor includes Theme Check, a feature that helps to prevent errors by providing immediate feedback as the code is being written, instead of discovering errors in your live theme.

In the code editor, Theme Check can identify the following errors in edited code:

* Parser blocking scripts, which can slow down a storefront
* Inconsistencies between translation files, such as missing translation keys or translations that don't match in a locale file
* Missing templates

Errors are indicated by a red line underneath the code. To view the error, hover your mouse over the highlighted line.

## Searching and replacing in the code editor

You can search within the code editor in either of the following ways:

* Search the code of a specific file.
* Search the code of all files in the theme.

You can also replace code in a specific file or multiple instances across all theme files. You can also search for a file by name to [open a file](edit-theme-code.md#open-file).

### Searching within a file

You can search the code in a specific file, and replace the code. Use the arrow keys to review each instance of the code.

After you search for code, you can replace the code in a file.

#### Steps:

1. From your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store** > [**Themes**](https://admin.shopify.com/themes).
2. Click  > **Edit code**.
3. Open the file that you want to search.

Click the search button in the left sidebar to search across all theme files. Results display every instance of your search term and which file it appears in.

### Advanced search options

To narrow down your search results, use one or more of the following search options:

* **Match case** returns search terms that match the case. For example, if you enter `product`, then the search highlights any instances of "product" or "Product". If you select **Match case**, then the search highlights instances of `product` only.
* **Match Whole Word** returns search terms that match the exact word, and excludes partial matches. For example, if you enter `cart`, then the search highlights instances of "cart" but not "carton".
* **Use Regular Expression** returns search results that match a regular expression (regex). A *regex* is a string of characters that specifies a match pattern in text.

In the **Search** panel, you can also select files and folders to include or exclude from the search results.

Click  to open the advanced menu. You can enter any file or folder path in the **files to include** or **files to exclude** fields. To add more than one file or folder, separate them with a space and comma. For example, to search for files in the **sections** folder, enter `./sections` in **files to include** field.

You can also search within a specific folder from the file directory view. Right-click on a folder, and then select **Find in folder...** from the dropdown menu.
