# Remove 'Powered by Shopify' from your online store

You can remove the "Powered by Shopify" message when you don't want it displayed in your store. Removing the message can create a cleaner footer and a more customized brand experience.

## On this page

* [Edit the default theme content](remove-powered-by-shopify-message.md#edit-the-default-theme-content)
* [Edit the theme code](remove-powered-by-shopify-message.md#edit-the-theme-code)

## Edit the default theme content

Desktop

1. From your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store** > [**Themes**](https://admin.shopify.com/themes).
2. Find the theme that you want to edit, and then click **…** > **Edit default theme content**.
3. In the **Filter items** search box, enter `powered`. This will bring up both the **Powered by Shopify** and **Powered by Shopify HTML** boxes.
4. In the **Powered by Shopify** box, enter a single space. If your store is password-protected, then you can repeat this step for the **Powered by Shopify HTML** box, which appears on your store's **Opening soon** page.
5. Click **Save**.
Mobile

1. From the [Shopify app](https://www.shopify.com/install/detect), tap the  icon.

3. Tap **Manage all themes**.

5. In the **Filter items** search box, enter `powered`. This will bring up both the **Powered by Shopify** and **Powered by Shopify HTML** boxes.
6. In the **Powered by Shopify** box, enter a single space. The faded placeholder text in the box disappears. If your store is password-protected, then you can repeat this step for the **Powered by Shopify HTML** box, which displays on your store's **Opening soon** page.
7. Tap **Save** or **✓**.
