## Background

Bid templates significantly reduce the time needed to create Bid Packages and Bid Forms. You can create templates for your bid forms and prospective bidders to use in your projects. These templates include details such as line items, amounts, included and excluded scope. Bidder lists can encompass both companies and specific bid recipients.

You have the option to create new templates or convert an existing bid package into a template.

When building bid packages for a project, simply select these templates to efficiently create your bid forms and bidder lists.
