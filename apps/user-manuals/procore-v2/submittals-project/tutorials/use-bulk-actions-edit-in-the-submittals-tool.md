## Steps

1. Navigate to the project's **Submittals** tool.
2. Locate the submittals to modify in the **Items**, **Packages**, **Specification Sections** or **Ball In Court** tabs. Then:

   - To select all of the submittals in the list, mark the checkbox at the top of the left column.  
      OR
   - To select one or more of the submittals in the list, mark the check box to the left of each desired submittal.
3. Choose **Bulk Actions** > **Edit** .   
   *Note*: The Bulk Actions menu is NOT available in the *Recycle Bin*. See [Perform Bulk Actions on Submittals](/product-manuals/submittals-project/tutorials/perform-bulk-actions-on-submittals).
4. Choose from these editing options:  
    (*Note:* Editing options in your project's Submittals tool can vary if your company has configured [custom fields](/faq-what-are-custom-fields-and-which-procore-tools-support-them) and [configurable fieldsets](/faq-what-are-configurable-fieldsets-and-which-procore-tools-support-them).)

   - **Specification Section**. Denotes the corresponding section from the project's specifications. See [Where do the selections in the 'Specification Sections' drop-down list in the Submittals tool come from?](/faq-where-do-the-selections-in-the-spec-sections-drop-down-list-come-from)
   - **Submittal Manager**. The name of the [submittal manager](/glossary-of-terms). This is the person who is responsible for overseeing the submittal throughout its lifecycle in Procore. Each submittal can have a different submittal manager, or your project team can configure a 'Default Submittal Manager' for all of your submittals. See [What is the 'Submittal Manager' role?](/faq-what-is-the-submittal-manager-role)
   - **Responsible Contractor**. The company that is responsible for completing the work specified on the submittal.

   - **Received From**. The contact for the responsible contractor who provided the submittal information to the project team.  
     *Note*: Users can only be added to the 'Received From' field if their Procore Directory record is associated to the company listed as the 'Responsible Contractor' on the submittal.

Then you are able to select the user's name in the 'Received From' menu.

   - **Remove from Distribution List.** Remove one (1) or more users and/or distribution groups from selected submittalsâ distribution lists.
   - **Private**. Select *Yes* to make the selected submittals Private. Otherwise, choose *No*.
   - **Status**. The current status of the submittal. Only a user with 'Admin' level permission to the Submittals tool can change a submittal's status.

   - **Received Date**. The date that the submittal information was received from the contractor/subcontractor responsible for the performing work associated with the submittal.
